# Lemmings 

Lemmings game made with SDL2 and entityx (entity component system framework). 

### Learn

- https://github.com/alecthomas/entityx

### Compile
Currently cmake lists will work only on windows with mingw. 
Download mingw versions of SDL and SDL_image from http://libsdl.org/ to libs folder. Also youll need to get last version of entityx and compile to libs folder.
I'll provide better cmake lists file later.
